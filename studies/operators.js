/** 
* 0.  OPERATORS:
* 
* 1. An operator performs some operation on single or multiple operands (data value) and produces a result. 
* 
* 2. There are many types of operators that can be used to perform these operations. The types of operators we will go over here is: Assignment Operators, Arithmetic Operators, Comparison Operators, Logical Operators, Unary Operators and Ternary Operator.
*
* 3. An ASSIGNMENT operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. 
*
* 4. Some Assignment operator types are:
*     The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.
*     The += assignment operator adds a value to a variable.
*     The -= assignment operator subtracts a value from a variable.
*     The -= assignment operator subtracts a value from a variable.
*     The /= assignment divides a variable.
*     The %= assignment operator assigns a remainder to a variable.
*
* 5. ARITHMETIC operators perform arithmetic on numbers (literals or variables).
*
* 6. Some Arithmetic operator types are:
*     The addition operator (+) adds numbers.
*     The subtraction operator (-) subtracts numbers.
*     The multiplication operator (*) multiplies numbers.
*     The division operator (/) divides numbers.
*     The modulus operator (%) returns the division remainder.
*     The increment operator (++) increments numbers.
*     The decrement operator (--) decrements numbers.
*     The exponentiation operator (**) raises the first operand to the power of the second operand.
*
* 7. COMPARISON operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values. 
*
* 8. Some Comparison Operator types are:
*     == 	equal to
*     === 	strictly equal to
*     != 	not equal
*     !== 	not equal value or not equal type (not strictly equal to)
*     > 	greater than
*     < 	less than
*     >= 	greater than or equal to
*     <= 	less than or equal to
*
* 9. LOGICAL operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.
*
* 10. Some Logical operators are:
*      && 	and
*      || 	or
*      ! 	not
*
* 11. TERNARY operator: JavaScript also contains a conditional operator that assigns a value to a variable based on some condition.
*
* 12. The syntax for a ternary operator is:
*      variablename = (condition) ? value1:value2 
*
* 13. A UNARY operator is one that takes a single operand/argument and performs an operation. Unary operators are more efficient than standard JavaScript function calls. Additionally, unary operators can not be overridden, therefore their functionality is guaranteed.
*
* 14. Some Unary operator types are:
*      Unary plus (+) 	Tries to convert the operand into a number
*      *Unary negation (-) * 	Tries to convert the operand into a number and negates after
*      Logical Not (!) 	Converts to boolean value then negates it
*      Increment (++) 	Adds one to its operand
*      Decrement (â€“) 	Decrements by one from its operand
*      Bitwise not (~) 	Inverts all the bits in the operand and returns a number
*      typeof 	Returns a string which is the type of the operand
*      delete 	Deletes specific index of an array or specific property of an object
*      void 	Discards a return value of an expression.
